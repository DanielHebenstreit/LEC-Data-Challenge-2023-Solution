# LEC Data Challenge 2023 TU Graz Data Team Solution

The current code presents the __winning solution__ developed during a contest called [LEC Data Challenge 2023](https://www.lec.at/research-area/lec-data-challenge-2023-neu/) organized at the request of the Large Engines Competence Center GmbH.


Please be aware that, due to legal constraints, I'm unable to share the dataset used in this project. Consequently, it is not included in this repository.
Furthermore, it's essential to note that due to tight time constraints and the urgency of meeting competition/task deadlines, the code might deviate at some parts from to the high quality standards we usually maintain.
